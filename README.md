# Assignments

## Modern Web Programming (COMP 426)

This repository contains information about and links to assignment invites and repositories.

### List of assignments

The assignments are designed to be cumulative skill-building exercises that will help you develop the knowledge and techniques necessary for building interactive web applications.

Some assignments will introduce important new material that isn't directly covered in lectures, but will likely be present in demos.

### Help with assignments

**_ALL_** questions and requests for help with assignments should start with the creation of an issue in the appropriate template repository.

You will find the links to the place to create those issues in the list of assignments above.

1. If you post something that should be an issue in the discussions, we will create an issue and move to the appropriate repo and help you there.
2. If you email regarding help with an assignment, you will be instructed to create an issue and we will help you there.
3. If you show up to office hours for help with problems related to an assignment, you **_MUST_** create an issue first. If you haven't created an issue you will be moved back into the queue and asked to create one before returning. 

### Assignment submission and grading

You will submit all assignments through GitHub classroom.
Instructions for setting this up are in the instructions for the first assignment.

All of the assignments will be autograded, meaning you will get near-instant feedback about your grade as you are working.

You may resubmit autograded assignments as many times as you wish, so feel free to keep trying until you find something that works.

#### Due dates

Due dates are there to guide you as to where you should be relative to the time remaining in the semester.
Assignment submission will not close at the due date, because you need to be able to push updates even after the due dates and are encouraged to do so.
You can still push to your assignment code repositories after the due date and it will update your grade.

To be successful in COMP 426, it is crucial to keep up with submitting assignments regularly and plan for the future assignments.
It is a big class that covers a lot of material and it can be easy to get behind or feel overwhelmed. 

We will try to focus on workflow management and planning practices in this class, since they are not usually explicitly taught. 

### Plagiarism in programming assignments

We learn by example and use examples to inspire us and help shape our approaches to solving problems.
That does not mean that it is okay to copy and paste code to solve a problem without attribution.

Most code examples you find will be but ONE example of how something can be done.
There are myriad ways to do any given thing, and they are all right, just different.
Some are more efficient than others, by some metric.
Some are more elegant than others.

This is where you get to be creative.
So, look at code, be inspired, and then BE CREATIVE.

Do your own work.
Do not copy and paste the work of others.

### Final term project (a99)

The final assignment for COMP 426 is a term project which you will complete as part of a team. 
Students will be assigned to teams of 3 to design, document, and develop a single term project. 

We will begin working on the final project within the first several weeks of the class.

#### Collaborative development

Each team membersâ€™s contribution to the project must be the result of their own individual effort. 
Be careful that you do not submit any code that you did not personally write.

**Your contributions to your team's project should be apparent in the GitHub repository itself. This is how we will track engagement.**

If you adapt open source code, make sure that you are following the license that the developers/maintainers distribute with the code.

**Submitting code copied from others or from the internet may result in your submission being flagged by the system for plagiarism.**
